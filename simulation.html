                <h1>Simulation</h1>
                <p> Simulation is an essential technique that paves the way for future technologies.
                     It allows developers to conserve valuable resources, such as time and money, all while increasing the effectiveness and robustness of a product.
                     Computer simulations date as far back as just after World War 2 with meteorology, and continues to help push the boundaries of scientific knowledge today. It is a rather larrge topic that encapsulates many industries (such as education and medicine, which can be found on this website), but here is a brief explanation of how they work, how they came to be, and some examples of what they can be used for.
                        </p>

                <h3>How do simulations work?</h3>
                    <p>A simulation is the process of applying a model over time. Computers can process information much faster than any human being. This allows them to be used to consider many different scenarios in a short amount of time. Since simulations use mathematical models results can vary greatly even with subtle changes. This allows people to predict the future in a sense, provided that a simulation has a detailed enough model to take into account significant variables. This can allow a solution to a problem to be discovered in a much faster time compared to human trial-and-error. Furthermore, developers won't need to create many prototypes of a product, because simulations can get the product to a near perfect stage.</p>
