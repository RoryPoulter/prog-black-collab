Peer Review feedback - Yonal's feedback
Everything seems solid, the content is interesting, The quality is consistent and visually pleasing.
Quality of written presentation is good.
There is sufficient evidence of collaboration and validity of html.

Only thing is maybe a slight bit more colour and the Logo is the word logo but honestly really nit-picking here you site is pretty much spotless:)
